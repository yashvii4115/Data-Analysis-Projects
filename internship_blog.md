My Internship Journey in Data Analysis at Samatrix Consulting

As a B.Tech student in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AIML) at CHARUSAT, I recently completed a one-month summer internship at Samatrix Consulting Pvt. Ltd. This internship was my first real opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to real-world problems, and it turned out to be a very enriching experience.

About Samatrix Consulting

Samatrix Consulting is a technology consulting and training company based in Gurgaon, India. The firm focuses on cutting-edge domains like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Blockchain, and Web 3.0.

Apart from consulting for industries such as healthcare, finance, and education, Samatrix also partners with universities to offer project-based learning programs. My internship was one such program, designed to provide hands-on data analysis experience through practical projects.

My Role and Objectives
I joined as a Trainee Data Analyst. The internship was structured for projects in different domains. 
The main objectives were:

* Apply data analysis techniques to real-world scenarios

* Strengthen technical skills with Python libraries

* Learn to draw insights from data and communicate them effectively

* Gain exposure to statistical methods and simulations


The projects were diverse, covering sports analytics, healthcare, customer service, and digital marketing.
Projects I Worked On:

1. IPL Team Performance Analysis
My first project focused on the Indian Premier League (IPL). I analyzed scoring patterns from 2008 to 2023, comparing playoff vs league matches, team performances, and pre-2018 vs post-2018 trends.

    Key insights:
 
    Teams like Mumbai Indians (MI) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) consistently performed well.
    Toss decisions and venues played an important role in match outcomes.
    Playoff vs league scores showed no significant difference.
    This project introduced me to exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistical testing.

2. Clinical Trial Survival Analysis
The second project explored survival analysis using lung cancer patient data. I used Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox Proportional Hazards model to compare standard and experimental treatments.

    Key insights:

    The experimental treatment did not show a statistically significant improvement in survival time compared to the standard treatment.
    Variables like cell type and age had a stronger influence on survival.
    This project helped me understand how data analytics supports evidence-based decision-making in healthcare.

3. Call Center Optimization
The third project was based on simulation of call center operations. I modeled how factors like agent count, call arrival rates, breaks, and customer patience affected performance.

    Key insights:

   Increasing agents reduced wait times significantly.
   Customer abandonment was an important factor to consider.
   Cost optimization often conflicted with customer satisfaction, showing the trade-off businesses face.
   I learned how queueing theory and simulations can be applied to real-world operational problems.

5. Website A/B Testing for Conversion Optimization
This project simulated an A/B test for two website landing pages. Using Z-tests and confidence intervals, I compared conversion rates of Variant A and Variant B.

    Key insights:

   Variant B outperformed Variant A with a significantly higher conversion rate.
   Sequential monitoring showed consistent improvement for Variant B over time.
   This project demonstrated how data-driven decision-making is applied in digital marketing and UX design.

6. Statistic_India_Election
This project focused on analyzing Indian election data to study patterns in voter demographics, regional party performance, and turnout trends.

    Key insights:

    Voter turnout varied significantly between urban and rural constituencies.
    Regional parties performed better in state-level elections, while national parties dominated in general elections.
    Age and gender demographics influenced voting trends, with younger voters showing different preferences compared to older groups.
    This project helped me practice statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and data visualization in a socio-political context.

7. Portfolio Risk Assessment & 1-Day 95% VaR Calculation
This project was based on financial risk management. I calculated the Value at Risk (VaR) for a stock portfolio using both parametric and simulation-based approaches.

    Key insights:

    The 1-day 95% VaR calculation showed the potential maximum loss with 95% confidence.
    Risk varied across portfolios depending on stock volatility and correlations.
    Comparing historical simulation vs parametric methods highlighted the importance of distribution assumptions.
    Through this, I gained hands-on experience in quantitative finance, risk modeling, and portfolio assessment.

8. Manufacturing Quality Control with Control Charts
The final project introduced me to statistical process control (SPC) techniques widely used in manufacturing.

    Key insights:

    Control charts were created to monitor production quality and detect variations.
    Identified “in-control” vs “out-of-control” processes.
    Demonstrated how early detection of process variation can prevent defects and reduce cost.
    This project gave me exposure to quality management and industrial analytics.


Skills and Tools Learned

Through these projects, I gained practical exposure to:

* Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Statsmodels

* Techniques: Data cleaning, visualization, hypothesis testing, regression, simulation models

* Concepts: Survival analysis, queueing theory, A/B testing, exploratory analysis

* Soft Skills: Presenting insights clearly, problem-solving, and time management


Challenges Faced

* Handling messy and incomplete data during cleaning

* Understanding complex survival models for medical data

* Choosing the right statistical methods for testing hypotheses

* Balancing cost vs quality trade-offs in simulations


Key Learnings

* Data analysis is not just about coding – it’s about asking the right questions.

* Statistical validation is essential before drawing conclusions.

* Visualizations make data storytelling powerful.

* Real-world problems often require balancing multiple factors (cost, quality, efficiency).


Conclusion & Reflection

This internship gave me a chance to work on seven diverse projects across multiple industries: sports, healthcare, customer service, marketing, governance, finance, and manufacturing. Each project was unique, yet all reinforced how powerful data analysis is for solving real-world problems.

I feel more confident now in my ability to handle data-driven decision-making and look forward to applying these skills in future academic and professional opportunities.

I am grateful to Samatrix Consulting for providing this opportunity and to my mentors and faculty at CHARUSAT for their constant support.
This was my journey into the world of Applied Data Analysis Projects. I look forward to building on this experience and taking on more challenging projects in the future.
